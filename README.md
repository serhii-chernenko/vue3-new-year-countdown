# New Years Countdown

# Challenge Description

Your task is to create a New Years countdown app.
It should meet the following requirements.

## Requirements

- Use the `CountdownSegment` component to display days, hours, minutes, and seconds until 00:00:00 of January 1st next year
- Each number should update approriately every second
- You should transition the minutes, seconds, etc as they tick by
- The `CountdownSegment` component must accept a `number` prop and use it to display how many x is left (x being days, minutes, etc)

## Other Considerations

> If you see an any `data-test` property in the boilerplate don't remove it
> it is needed. If you remove it your code may be invalid for the certificate.

> TailwindCSS is preinstalled and with default config.
> It might be helpful for you if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise.
